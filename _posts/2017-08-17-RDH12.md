Uniprot [Q96NR8](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96NR8){:target="_blank"}

Exhibits an oxidoreductive catalytic activity towards retinoids.
 Most efficient as an NADPH-dependent retinal reductase. Displays high activity toward 9-cis and all-trans-retinol. 
 Also involved in the metabolism of short-chain aldehydes. No steroid dehydrogenase activity detected.
 Might be the key enzyme in the formation of 11-cis-retinal from 11-cis-retinol during regeneration of the cone visual pigments.
