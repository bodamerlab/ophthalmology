Myosins are actin-based motor molecules with ATPase activity.
 Unconventional myosins serve in intracellular movements. 
 Their highly divergent tails bind to membranous compartments,
  which are then moved relative to actin filaments. In the retina, 
  plays an important role in the renewal of the outer photoreceptor disks.
   Plays an important role in the distribution and migration of retinal 
   pigment epithelial (RPE) melanosomes and phagosomes, and in the regulatio
   n of opsin transport in retinal photoreceptors. In the inner ear, 
   plays an important role in differentiation, morphogenesis and organization of 
   cochlear hair cell bundles. Involved in hair-cell vesicle trafficking of aminoglycosides, 
   which are known to induce ototoxicity (By similarity). Motor protein that is a 
   part of the functional network formed by USH1C, USH1G, CDH23 and MYO7A that mediates 
   mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. Required for normal hearing
