Involved in early and late steps in cilia formation. Its association with CCP110 is required 
for inhibition of primary cilia formation by CCP110 (PubMed:18694559). May play a role in early 
ciliogenesis in the disappearance of centriolar satellites and in the transition of primary ciliar vesicles (PCVs) 
to capped ciliary vesicles (CCVs). Required for the centrosomal recruitment of RAB8A and for the targeting 
of centriole satellite proteins to centrosomes such as of PCM1 (PubMed:24421332). 
Required for the correct localization of ciliary and phototransduction proteins in retinal photoreceptor cells; 
may play a role in ciliary transport processes (By similarity). 
Required for efficient recruitment of RAB8A to primary cilium (PubMed:17705300). 
In the ciliary transition zone is part of the tectonic-like complex which is required for tissue-specific 
ciliogenesis and may regulate ciliary membrane composition (By similarity). 
Involved in regulation of the BBSome complex integrity, specifically for presence of BBS2, BBS5 and BBS8/TTC8 
in the complex, and in ciliary targeting of selected BBSome cargos. 
May play a role in controlling entry of the BBSome complex to cilia possibly implicating IQCB1/NPHP5 (PubMed:25552655). 
Activates ATF4-mediated transcription (PubMed:16682973)
