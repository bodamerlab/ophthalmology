Transfers the acyl group from the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine to all-trans retinol, 
producing all-trans retinyl esters. Retinyl esters are storage forms of vitamin A. 
LRAT plays a critical role in vision. It provides the all-trans retinyl ester substrates 
for the isomerohydrolase which processes the esters into 11-cis-retinol in the retinal pigment 
epithelium; due to a membrane-associated alcohol dehydrogenase, 11 cis-retinol is oxidized and converted 
into 11-cis-retinaldehyde which is the chromophore for rhodopsin and the cone photopigments.
