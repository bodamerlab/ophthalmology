 Opsin proteins are named for the short (blue, OPN1SW), medium (green, OPN1MW), 
 and long (red, OPN1LW) wavelengths of light that they detect within different populaitons of cone photoreceptors. 
 Individuals with mutations in the long or medium wavelengths of light are colorblind and have difficulty distinguishing
  colors other than blue on a yellow background.
