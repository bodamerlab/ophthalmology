Plays important roles in the production of 11-cis retinal and in visual pigment regeneration. 
The soluble form binds vitamin A (all-trans-retinol), making it available for LRAT processing 
to all-trans-retinyl ester. The membrane form, palmitoylated by LRAT, binds all-trans-retinyl 
esters, making them available for IMH (isomerohydrolase) processing to all-cis-retinol. 
The soluble form is regenerated by transferring its palmitoyl groups onto 11-cis-retinol, 
a reaction catalyzed by LRAT. The enzymatic activity is linearly dependent of the expression 
levels and membrane association.
